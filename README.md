# TokenRiface
Interface to ERC20 TokenR contract from external centralised apps.

This is a separate repository to include the interfaces. It should be able to derive TokenR contracts and meta info. This should include interfaces to all supported external sources like web3 based websites, applications and wallets. This should only refer contracts not include any updates to contracts. It may act as a common layer between different external applications on different platforms to smart contract.
